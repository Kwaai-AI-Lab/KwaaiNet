0 broken reference(s), 101 warning(s) across 51 files

Drift is a prompt to re-read, not a failure. Reflect on whether the doc still says something true, then touch it or fix it.
```

0 broken references. All 101 warnings are in `plans/*.md` (checked loosely, per the script's own design — most are
"proposed?" file refs for files a plan intends to create, not rot). None of the 12 `CLAUDE.md` files or
`GLOSSARY.md` produced a warning: no broken refs, no age-drift.

## Semantic — claims now false, with file, line, and the commit responsible

`git log --since="36 hours ago" --stat` returned **zero commits**. The last commit to the default branch
(`d46bb4a`, "chore: remove private D6 corpus material from the public tree") landed 2026-10-07 10:10:36 -0700,
about 41 hours before this run — outside the window. Nothing to check this cycle under the 36-hour rule.

One pre-existing false claim surfaced by the checker's own warning (not a 36-hour-window finding, but verified
against the code since it was flagged):

- `projects/kwaai-knowledge/plans/RAGPerformanceReport-20260712.md:130` — "**Status**: code complete, not yet
  committed." for the SQLite WAL migration described just above it (replacing `redb` with `rusqlite`, `MetaStore`
  behind `Mutex<SafeConn>`, `journal_mode=WAL; synchronous=NORMAL; cache_size=-65536` pragmas). This landed in
  commit `4aec1f0` ("ci: fail a PR that inserts a Rust item into an existing doc block (#214)", 2026-09-10) —
  the pragmas and `Mutex`-wrapped `MetaStore`/`GraphStore`/`QueryCache` are all present in
  `core/crates/kwaai-rag/src/{meta_store,cache,graph,feedback}.rs` today. The claim is a month stale. This is a
  dated results report, not an instruction file, so the risk is low (a reader checking "has this landed" gets a
  wrong answer), but it's a one-line fix: change the status line to say when it landed.

## Accretion — what could be removed and why

Checked two candidates, both ruled out:

- **Hardcoded peer IDs** (`metro-linux`, `metro-win`, `jerome`) in `projects/kwaai-compute/CLAUDE.md` and
  `projects/kwaai-knowledge/CLAUDE.md` — these are the pattern the task brief calls out as a typical accretion
  smell, but they're corroborated by `docs/runbooks/metro-linux-hardware.md`, `tests/kwaai-network/stress/`, and
  current crate source (`relay_manager.rs`, `addresses.rs`). Live infrastructure reference, not rot.
- **`projects/kwaai-knowledge/plans/MemoryIntegrity-growth-cycle.md`** — this is the design doc for the routine
  that produced this report. Its "proposed?" warnings above (`hivemind.rs`, `fn_name()`, etc.) are illustrative
  placeholders inside a worked example, not real claims. §6 already says "implemented" and accurately describes
  the current 4-step/36-hour-lookback routine. Not stale.

One real item, already named above: the status line in `RAGPerformanceReport-20260712.md` is the kind of thing
this section should flag — not for removal, but it's a report that still reads as in-progress for work that
landed a month ago.

Beyond that, I did not do a full pass over all 37 files in `projects/kwaai-knowledge/plans/` tonight — that's a
large surface and the mechanical checker already treats most of their warnings as expected (future-dated
proposals). If a deeper accretion sweep of that directory is wanted, it should be its own pass rather than
riding on a night with zero commits to review.

## Nothing found

No broken references. No commits in the lookback window, so no semantic findings tied to this cycle's code
changes.
