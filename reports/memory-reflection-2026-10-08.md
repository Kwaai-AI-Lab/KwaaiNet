0 broken reference(s), 101 warning(s) across 51 files

Drift is a prompt to re-read, not a failure. Reflect on whether the doc still says something true, then touch it or fix it.
```

Exit code 0, zero broken references. All 101 warnings are in `plans/` documents, not in the
twelve `CLAUDE.md` files or `GLOSSARY.md`.

One worth a note for whoever reads this next: several of the `(proposed?)` warnings above
(`d6_family_tree.yaml`, `d6_doc_schema.yaml`, `d6_entity_schema.yaml`,
`d6_entity_type_schemas.yaml`, `d6_doc_meta.yaml`, `d6_experiments_log.md`) are mislabeled by
the checker's heuristic — these files aren't proposed-but-never-built, they existed in the repo
until commit `d46bb4a` (see Semantic, below) moved them to a private copy. The checker can't
tell "never existed" from "existed and was deliberately removed," so don't read "(proposed?)"
on these specific names as "someone's future work."

## Semantic — claims now false, with file, line, and the commit responsible

Only one commit landed in the 36-hour window: `d46bb4a` ("remove private D6 corpus material
from the public tree", #243). Its diff is 1,320 files, but only two are not deletions:
`.gitignore` (new D6 section) and `projects/kwaai-knowledge/CLAUDE.md`. No `.rs` source file
changed — confirmed via `git show d46bb4a --stat | grep '\.rs'`, whose only hit is a deleted
markdown filename that happens to contain the substring "rs". So none of the checks this step
calls out by name apply this cycle: no CLI subcommand was renamed or removed, no documented
default/threshold/cap/flag value changed in code, no "do not do X" guidance was undercut by new
machinery, and no described behaviour was inverted.

I read the `projects/kwaai-knowledge/CLAUDE.md` edit against the deletion it documents
(`CLAUDE.md:30-33`, `CLAUDE.md:86`): it adds the line "D6 is a private corpus and must never be
committed to this public repo" and rewrites the doc-schema section from "Located at
`tests/kwaai-knowledge/d6_doc_schema.yaml`" to "Kept in the private D6 copy ... gitignored,"
with a blanket note that the `tests/kwaai-knowledge/d6_*` paths still shown in the rebuild/eval/
seed command examples "do not exist in a fresh clone." That note covers every other `d6_*` path
left in the same file (lines 45-57, 91, 125-129), so nothing there was left stale by its own
companion edit.

**Nothing found false.** No other memory file references the removed D6 fixtures as if they
were checked into the public tree.

## Accretion

- `projects/kwaai-knowledge/plans/RAGPerformanceReport-20260712.md:130` — `**Status**: code
  complete, not yet committed.` I checked: the feature it describes (SQLite WAL pragmas,
  `journal_mode=WAL; synchronous=NORMAL; cache_size=-65536`) is present today in
  `core/crates/kwaai-rag/src/feedback.rs`, `cache.rs`, and `meta_store.rs`. The status line is
  stale — this predates the 36-hour window (file last touched by an unrelated commit, July) so
  it isn't this cycle's doing, but it's a clean, verified removal/update candidate.
- The D6-era plan backlog in `projects/kwaai-knowledge/plans/` (`D6-FullAB-results.md`,
  `D6-NoSeed-Dream-plan.md`, `D6-OntologyAB-testplan.md`, `DreamRAG-Eval2-plan.md`,
  `Phase4-EntityRelations-plan.md`, `Phase5-TrainedClassifiers-plan.md`, and others) is where
  most of the 101 checker warnings concentrate. Several describe phases the project-level
  `projects/kwaai-knowledge/CLAUDE.md` already records as confirmed/settled (the "Optimal entity
  extraction settings (Phase 3 confirmed)" table). Now that D6's own fixtures are explicitly
  private-only, this is a reasonable batch to triage — fold anything still load-bearing into the
  project `CLAUDE.md`/`GLOSSARY.md` and archive the rest — but it's a volume and ownership call
  for whoever runs that project, not something to remove unilaterally in this pass.
- Not checked, flagging instead of guessing: `projects/kwaai-knowledge/CLAUDE.md:101-105` lists
  three hardcoded p2p peer IDs for named machines (`metro-linux`, `metro-win`, `jerome`). I have
  no way to confirm from this checkout whether those peers are still live; would need a running
  kwaainet daemon with p2p connectivity to check.

## Nothing found

The 36-hour window held exactly one commit, and it was a pure data-removal change plus one
self-consistent doc update — no CLI, default, or behavioural claim elsewhere in the twelve
`CLAUDE.md` files or `GLOSSARY.md` was invalidated by it.
