0 broken reference(s), 65 warning(s) across 51 files

Drift is a prompt to re-read, not a failure. Reflect on whether the doc still says something true, then touch it or fix it.
```

Exit code 0.

Exit code 0. All 65 warnings are in `projects/*/plans/*.md` and are either
"(proposed?)" references to files a plan describes but that were never built,
or line-number drift in historical plan docs (the symbol still exists, just at
a different line). None are in a `CLAUDE.md` or in `GLOSSARY.md` — the 12
files this task cares most about are clean. No new breakage.

## Semantic — claims now false, with file, line, and the commit responsible

Only two commits landed in the last 36 hours, both already carrying their own
"Reviewed at / findings fixed at" notes and a recorded list of known
limitations in the commit message itself:

- `e4e9aa9` (#238) — nix/crane.nix: restores patched crates after crane's dummy
  stubbing, adds protoc. No `CLAUDE.md` documents crane/nix build internals in
  enough detail to be contradicted by this.
- `97d0b1e` (#239) — kwaai-rag: deterministic graph retrieval, capped
  gap-fill, prose-preserving dream, Eval v2 harness.

Checked `#239` specifically against `core/crates/kwaai-rag/CLAUDE.md` and
`projects/kwaai-knowledge/CLAUDE.md` + `GLOSSARY.md`, since it's the one
touching documented behavior:

- The new `graph-only` retrieval mode and `--dump-jsonl` eval flag (added to
  `cli.rs`) aren't enumerated anywhere in memory — nothing to go stale.
- `GLOSSARY.md`'s "Dream cycle" / "Dream task kind" entries describe the
  pipeline at a level general enough that the prose-preserving field-summary
  fix doesn't contradict them.
- `kwaai-knowledge/CLAUDE.md`'s "Do not enable unfiltered relation extraction
  for 8B models" line already names the Phase-4 axiomatic pipeline as the
  sanctioned alternative — it predates this reflection and isn't touched by
  either commit.

**Nothing found.** No memory file asserts something either commit made untrue.

## Accretion — what could be removed and why

Nothing new to remove from this reflection cycle. One pre-existing item worth
a mention for a future pass: `projects/kwaai-knowledge/plans/
RAGPerformanceReport-20260712.md:130` still says "code complete, not yet
committed" against a `kwaai-rag/src` that has changed substantially since
(the checker flags this every run). It's a dated, filename-stamped snapshot
report rather than a living doc, so I'm not confident deleting or editing it
is correct — flagging rather than acting.

## Nothing found

Semantic section: clean, as above. No commands, defaults, flags, or
subcommands referenced in a `CLAUDE.md`/`GLOSSARY.md` were invalidated by the
two commits in the last 36 hours.
