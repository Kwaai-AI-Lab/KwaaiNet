0 broken reference(s), 117 warning(s) across 53 files

Drift is a prompt to re-read, not a failure. Reflect on whether the doc still says something true, then touch it or fix it.
```

0 broken references. None of the 117 warnings land in the twelve `CLAUDE.md` files or
`GLOSSARY.md` — all are in `projects/*/plans/*.md`, and almost all are either forward-looking
"proposed" file/function names in design docs (not yet written, as expected) or line-number
drift the checker itself treats as informational. One warning stands out and is followed up
under Accretion below: the `RAGPerformanceReport-20260712.md` self-flag that its "not yet
committed" status may be stale.

## Semantic — claims now false, with file, line, and the commit responsible

`git log --since="36 hours ago" --stat` on this checkout (HEAD `c6da5da`, current UTC time
2026-10-25 10:04) returned **no commits**. The most recent commit (`c6da5da`, "fix(ci): patch
the Windows installer for CUDA...") is from 2026-10-23 11:25:41 -0700, about 40 hours before
this run — outside the window.

Nothing to check: no code changed in the last 36 hours, so no memory-file claim could have
been invalidated by a recent commit. I did not go looking for staleness against older history,
since that's outside this step's scope (the checker and a wider sweep are what Step 3 is for).

## Accretion — what could be removed and why

1. **`projects/kwaai-knowledge/plans/RAGPerformanceReport-20260712.md:130`** — `**Status**:
   code complete, not yet committed.` (referring to the redb → rusqlite/WAL migration). This is
   stale, and has been for a while, not just since yesterday: `journal_mode=WAL` is live in
   `core/crates/kwaai-rag/src/{meta_store,graph,cache,feedback}.rs`, `Cargo.toml` depends on
   `rusqlite = "0.31"`, and the workspace is at version `0.7.2` — while the report's own header
   claims `Binary version: v0.4.148+`. The migration this line describes as pending shipped
   long ago; the doc is dated 2026-07-12, over three months stale on this one line. Recommend
   either updating the status line to reflect that it's shipped, or striking it since the rest
   of the report is a point-in-time benchmark snapshot that doesn't depend on it.

2. **Duplicated infrastructure table**: the same three-machine peer-ID table (metro-linux,
   metro-win, jerome) is maintained in two places —
   `projects/kwaai-compute/CLAUDE.md:31-36` and `projects/kwaai-knowledge/CLAUDE.md:100-111` —
   with identical peer IDs copied verbatim into each. Two copies of operational data (peer IDs,
   GPU descriptions) can drift independently; a machine swap or re-key would need to be applied
   twice; `projects/kwaai-knowledge/CLAUDE.md` already shows an extra `jerome` row with the
   GPU column blank where `kwaai-compute`'s copy doesn't, which is a small sign they're already
   not kept in lockstep. I could not verify from this container whether the peer IDs
   themselves are still live (no network path to the p2p mesh from here) — that would need
   someone who can reach the relay to confirm `metro-linux` / `metro-win` / `jerome` still
   resolve, which `projects/kwaai-knowledge/plans/RAGPerformanceReport-20260712.md` already
   noted `jerome` was offline for as of 2026-07-12. Recommend consolidating to one canonical
   location (likely `kwaai-network`, which owns P2P routing) and having the other file
   reference it.

No other accretion candidates found: no absolute user paths, no other hardcoded peer IDs/hashes
outside the table above, and no plan document that is silently superseded without saying so —
the one plan that calls itself superseded (`D6-OntologyAB-testplan.md`, "run, and superseded by
its own results") already says so in its own status line, which is the honest way to leave a
superseded plan in place.

## Nothing found

- No broken references (mechanical).
- No commits in the last 36 hours, so no semantic contradiction to report for this window.
- `GLOSSARY.md` carries no warnings and nothing here flagged it as stale.
